  The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

  The div tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

  The div tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.

  Any sort of content can be put inside the div tag!

  <div class="red">Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the div element.</div><br>

  The span tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

  The span tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.

  <span class="red">The span tag is much like the div element, but div is a block-level element and span is an
  inline element.</span>
